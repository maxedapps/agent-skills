# Implement Plan

## Hard rules

- Stay on the plan’s required outcome. Discovery/review do **not** add scope.
- Prefer the smallest behavior-preserving change. Skip unnecessary abstractions/tests/safeguards.
- **Delegate by default** when safe. “Small/easy” is not a reason to skip subagents.
- Leverage subagents — built-in, extensions/plugins, or skills. Follow `use-subagents` policy; use native subagents, extensions / plugins, or other skills
- Main agent owns: tracker, integration, dispositions, acceptance, user comms, cleanup.
- Child handoffs = evidence, never acceptance. Inspect diffs; rerun checks.
- Findings / `decomplex` recs never auto-create work — disposition first.
- Material doubt, scope/risk choices, or stuck review loops → **ask user**.
- Never fake `Complete`.

## Startup (blocking)

1. Read the **full** plan (offset if truncated).
2. **Read** [`assets/progress-tracker-template.md`](assets/progress-tracker-template.md) with the file tool (memory doesn’t count).
3. Leverage subagents — built-in, extensions/plugins, or via skills.
4. Copy/adapt tracker into the plan or a standalone file.
5. Map every actionable plan requirement → tracker rows (split compound work into tasks/subtasks).
6. Record `Template loaded from: implement-plan/assets/progress-tracker-template.md`.
7. Only then implement.

On resume: repeat startup and reconcile. Missing template → stop.

## Task loop

For each dependency-ready task/subtask (delegate by default):

1. **Analyze** — read starts-at paths, callers, tests; research only if needed (`web-research` when third-party/current behavior is uncertain).
2. **Implement** — smallest change that satisfies the row; stay in ownership; record deviations.
3. **Check** — targeted tests + applicable lint/typecheck/build/migration/browser (`agent-browser` for UI).
4. **Review** — independent `code-review` when the task crosses a real boundary, or when the batch/phase completes; always for final full-plan review.
5. **Disposition** findings:
   - `Fix now` · `Validate` · `Reject` · `Ask user` · `Block`
   - Fix accepted items (delegate); rerun checks; focused re-review until `Clear`
   - Complexity-increasing fix → `decomplex` triage if available, else built-in gate; doubt → ask user
   - Two failed rounds / recurrence / no progress → ask user
6. **Update tracker** — `Verified` needs evidence; `Descoped` needs user approval.
7. **Cleanup** lane resources per `use-subagents` (and launcher runtime cleanup, e.g. Pi `clean`, if used) — no unaccounted workflow-owned resources.
8. Next ready task/subtask.

Parallelize only independent tasks with isolated writers. Parent is sole tracker writer under concurrency.

## When to review

- After major boundaries: integration, migration, public contract, security/data invariant, risky dep, delivery milestone
- Plan-authored checkpoints
- Final full-plan review (plan-backed)

Fresh reviewers; don’t share conclusions pre-handoff. One reviewer default. Parent review only if independent review is unavailable — record the limit.

Reviewer states: `Clear` · `Changes required` · `Human decision required` · `Blocked`

## Done

1. Reread full plan — no missed requirements.
2. No row `Pending` / `In progress` / `Blocked`.
3. Diff hygiene — drop unjustified scope/complexity.
4. Final checks + final plan-backed review (+ `decomplex` Audit of **this** diff if proportionate).
5. Final cleanup — worktrees, branches, processes, runtime state.
6. Report truthfully.

`Complete` only when all rows are `Verified` or approved `Descoped`, validation passed, final review is `Clear`, and nothing material remains open. Else `Partial` or `Blocked`.

## Report

- plan/tracker paths · status · remaining IDs
- what was delegated vs parent-owned (and why)
- checks run / skipped
- review outcomes + dispositions
- decisions, deviations
- worktrees created/integrated/removed · retained resources + why
